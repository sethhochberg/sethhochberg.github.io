    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After seeing the <a href="/blog/2012/09/06/the-osprey-lab-subwoofer/">Osprey Dual LAB</a> in action, a friend of mine wanted me to help her pick out a subwoofer setup for her car. We decided we could do one better than something off the shelf, so it became time to take the great Dual LAB design and distill it down to something that would actually be reasonable for installation into a Honda Civic. The second goal here was to keep cost down and simplify construction, so that meant some interesting twists like keeping the external dimensions close to minimize need for internal bracing, using PVC pipe for port tubes, etc.</p>

<p>What'd I come up with?</p>

<p>The box was very compact, took a LAB 12 driver, and simulated really well (as evidenced by the plots below):</p>

<p>Time to build! The parts collection was indeed simple, which was perfect! A half-sheet of MDF was plenty, and since this was going into a car, MDF was a fine material, we didn't need the birch plywood the Dual LAB got.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I never got a picture of this one when it was all built. We finished the cabinet in your standard "rat fur" black carpet, and it still sits happily in the trunk of that Honda Civic. Maybe you've heard it if you're in north Pinellas County.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Osprey LAB Sub is named for the company name I was operating under a few years ago when I built it, Osprey Audio, and the Eminence LAB 12 drivers it uses. The rough basis for the project's design was a dual 12" subwoofer built by Art Welter of Welter Systems in New Mexico, who had some old w-bin subwoofers he wanted to modernize and gutting them to install the LAB 12 drivers was his solution. I liked the form factor of his work, and his choice in drivers, so I set out to put my own spin on them without the constraints of the existing boxes he worked with.</p>

<p>A few pictures from the construction process...</p>

<p>After caulk and foam, before the drivers go in:

<p>Note that the lid of the box makes up the top wall of the top port, also. The port design was intended to keep things as simple as possible internally.</p>

<p>At the first sound check...</p>

<p><img src="https://d2ue6wpj4p2l5d.cloudfront.net/dual_lab_built.jpg"></p>

<p>Drivers are wired in parallel, and the box eventually was finished in a thick black outdoor deck sealant, with a 14ga steel grille from Parts Express.</p>

<p>What can it do?</p>

<p>Pretty good.</p>
