    <section>
        <p>I'm a hands-on technology leader with well over a decade of experience building and operating digital products - from legacy streaming media to venture-backed startups, and now the intersection of insurance and finance. I've helped companies navigate acquisitions, scale from in-office to globally distributed teams, and bring products to market on flexible, secure, and compliant technical platforms.</p>
        <p>Currently, I serve as the CIO at <a href="https://www.wysh.com" target="_blank">Wysh</a>, a financial protection company pioneering micro life insurance in the U.S. I lead our cloud infrastructure, information technology, and information security functions; own our enterprise technology strategy; and serve as the lead architect in support of our software engineering teams.</p>

    <section>
        <p>Information security is everywhere in my professional work, and everywhere in the industry as a topic of equal importance from tiny startups to large enterprises.</p>
        <p>I'm an accredited member of <a href="https://www.isc2.org/" target="_blank">ISC2</a> and hold a CISSP certification as well as its security architecture specialization, the ISSAP - and use these alongside my own experiences designing security into startup technology and culture to consult with growing businesses. Software startups are high-risk environments, but attention to detail at the right places and right times can help them move quickly with confidence and use appropriate attention to security as a differentiator. Reach out via email for a consultation.</p>

        <p>In years past, I used to build teams and communities in my work as the General Manager of <a href="https://www.overclock.net" target="_blank">Overclock.net</a>, which eventually became part of the Wikia / Fandom family of enthusiast websites. It was the largest performance computing discussion board of its kind on the internet, with half a million members having discussions and creating editorial content viewed 20 million+ times each month.</p>
        <p>Prior to OCN's own acquisition by Wikia, I worked closely with the talented folks at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/huddler">Huddler</a>, our community software provider, on product improvements to their community platform and developing a set of best practices for forum community engagement across other Huddler communities. We were pioneering community influence and responsible brand participation long before "influencer" was a broadly used term.</p>

        <p>When I worked at <a href="https://di.fm" target="_blank">Digitally Imported</a>, my day job was all about software and servers - but after we transitioned from terrestrial-style radio with realtime steam encoding to a modern, CDN-based streaming architecture, we could have staff playlists! I curated a few, and one of them is still in their rotation: <a href="https://www.di.fm/playlists/a-lighter-side-of-techno">DI.FM: A Lighter Side of Techno</a>.</p>
        <p>Before getting into the tech industry, I worked in academic recording studios and concert halls in the greater Miami area, with a niche in big band and salsa orchestra. One of my big band recordings of a University of Miami ensemble won Downbeat Magazine's <a href="https://downbeat.com/digitaledition/2013/spcsma/_art/DBSMA13.pdf" target="_blank">Best Engineered Live Recording for the year 2013</a> in the Student Music Awards.</p>

        <p>On Github, I've published source code for a few small projects, mostly from my academic years.</p>
        <p>An interesting one is <a href="https://github.com/sethhochberg/SpaceyDelayer" target="_blank">SpaceyDelayer: a fun, VST-compatible audio processing plugin</a> that emulates classic multitap tape delay hardware like the Boss RE-20. The novel feature of SpaceyDelayer is that the offset time between taps in the delay is configurable - in a typical multitap tape delay, the user can specify the time between the initial playback and the first delay, but with SpaceyDelayer, the interval between the pluginâ€™s 3 delay taps is also configurable. It was developed in C++ using <a href="https://www.willpirkle.com" target="_blank">Will Pirkle</a>'s RackAFX plugin prototyping system.</p>
